# Csharp-game

Instructions Gemwaves
Swap gems to make three or more  same-colored gems in a row. Every move has to make a match of three or more gems. Clear gems to increase your score when you reach a certain score you will level up. Each level higher means you need more matches to advance. If there are no more possible moves left, the game ends. Only one player can play this at a time, there is no time limit on trying to find matches.
